# Logic Map

## Overview
This document explains the logic chain for updating `UPDATES_STRATEGY.md` with standardized list formatting while preserving the intent of each section.

## Logic Chain (Steps 1–3)
1. **Identify the target scope**
   - The requested change focuses on list markers within `UPDATES_STRATEGY.md`.
   - Objective: normalize bullet spacing while preserving content meaning.
2. **Preserve semantic content**
   - Keep each section title and bullet text intact.
   - Ensure the meaning of each "Current State," "Upgrade," and "Benefit" statement remains unchanged.
3. **Apply precise formatting corrections**
   - Replace indented bullet markers (`*   `) with a consistent bullet marker (`* `).
   - Confirm that headings remain unchanged and list order is preserved.

## Verification Notes
- The change is localized to list marker spacing.
- No text content is altered beyond whitespace normalization.
- Section order and labels are preserved for traceability.
