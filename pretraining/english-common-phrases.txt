Good morning, how are you today?
Good afternoon, nice to see you again.
Good evening, welcome to our home.
Good night, sleep well and sweet dreams.
Thank you very much for your help.
You are welcome, happy to assist you.
Please excuse me, I need to go.
I am sorry for the inconvenience caused.
No problem at all, do not worry.
It is nice to meet you here.
Pleased to make your acquaintance today.
How have you been doing lately?
What have you been up to recently?
I have been keeping busy with work.
Things have been going well for me.
I cannot complain about anything really.
Everything is fine, thank you for asking.
Could you please help me with this?
Would you mind if I asked a question?
May I have your attention please?
Can you tell me where this is?
I would like to know more about that.
That is very interesting to hear.
I did not know that fact before.
Tell me more about your experience there.
What do you think about this idea?
In my opinion, that seems reasonable.
I agree with what you are saying.
I disagree with that particular point.
That is a good question to ask.
Let me think about that for a moment.
I am not sure about the answer.
I do not know the solution yet.
Perhaps we could try another approach.
That might work better than the first.
It is worth considering all options available.
We should look at this more carefully.
Take your time, there is no rush.
Please feel free to ask questions anytime.
I understand what you mean by that.
That makes sense to me now.
I see your point of view clearly.
You have a valid concern there.
That is true in many cases indeed.
On the other hand, consider this perspective.
From another angle, it looks different entirely.
It depends on the specific situation involved.
There are many factors to consider here.
The answer is not always simple or clear.
Sometimes things are more complicated than expected.
Let us discuss this matter further tomorrow.
We can talk about it more later.
I will get back to you soon.
Please keep me informed of any changes.
I appreciate your patience with this.
Thank you for understanding the situation.
Your cooperation is greatly appreciated here.
I value your input and suggestions.
Your feedback is important to us.
We take your concerns seriously always.
I will do my best to help.
Let me see what I can do.
I will look into that right away.
Give me a moment to check on this.
Just a second, I will be right back.
Hold on, I am almost finished here.
Wait a minute, something is not right.
One moment please, let me confirm that.
Excuse me, could you repeat that please?
I did not quite catch what you said.
Could you speak a little more slowly?
I am having trouble understanding you.
Let me explain this more clearly now.
Allow me to clarify what I meant.
What I meant to say is this.
In other words, here is the idea.
To put it simply, this is what happens.
The main point is this important fact.
The bottom line is what matters most.
At the end of the day, this is key.
When all is said and done, remember this.
The long and short of it is this.
