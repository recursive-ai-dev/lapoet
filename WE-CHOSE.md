# Perspective Selection

## Purpose
Document the three-perspective planning approach for the formatting adjustment in `UPDATES_STRATEGY.md` and why the chosen path preserves clarity and maintainability.

## Perspectives
### CEO Perspective
- **Goal:** Maintain clear, professional documentation with consistent formatting.
- **Concern:** Small formatting inconsistencies can reduce perceived quality in strategy docs.

### Junior Developer Perspective
- **Goal:** Apply minimal, safe changes without altering meaning.
- **Concern:** Avoid unintended edits that could alter technical intent.

### End Customer Perspective
- **Goal:** Readable, uniform formatting that communicates project direction clearly.
- **Concern:** Inconsistent formatting distracts from content and reduces trust.

## Decision
- **Chosen approach:** Minimal, localized formatting normalization.
- **Why:** Aligns with all three perspectives by improving readability while preserving meaning and reducing risk.
- **Mapped logic chain reference:** LOGIC-MAP.md (Steps 1–3).
