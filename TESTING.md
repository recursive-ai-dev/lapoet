# Testing

## Scope
This change is documentation-only and does not affect runtime behavior. The verification approach focuses on file integrity and formatting consistency.

## Tests Executed
- None. Documentation-only update.

## Edge Case Reasoning
- Ensured headings and bullet text remain unchanged aside from whitespace normalization.
- Confirmed the file renders correctly with standard Markdown list formatting.
