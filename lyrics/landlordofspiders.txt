I'm a ghost haunting hallways that haven't been built yet 
Trapped inside what could happen through paths the hills wept for my cleansing 
Fear of losing mind to failed attention to the sense 
I have to kill the time 
I have left 
But real is 
I’m a fact away from stilling life and feeling 
After feelings from ascending past the need to dry 
The water given from the well instead of drinking it to then feel fine and better 
For now the dreams rise thick with altar smoke, 
I worship chaos, a descendant 
Each thought a charged, cracked hymn wrapped in what will give and what this ends with 
Fight or flight, or maybe three times stress to get some point across 
I know, 
I never keep promises 
I make at night 
At least 
I’m first to know that 
I sit and fold the corners of a phone number once given, see my reflection in the toaster 
And didn’t that motherfucker lip and start blinking in 
Morse code 
The roaches started fighting with the mice 
The known instigator was life, or the fight to life 
Survival mode 
I etched my name inside the fading memory of the house we used to hang 
After cleaning out my stash 
So 
I can crawl back when my blood forgets me 
Reap the sane in attics 
Addicts reach the flame then grab it 
Passing right through shame and stab a known hand 
Please don’t get upset, see 
Reaching out to pass them gloves 
They need them now 
I stabbed them 
And all for habits that trace back to why 
I handle blades, established 
Something that returns even when unwelcome to this day 
They say relapse wears the robes of ritual 
I say help them pray 
Counting spiders as apostles isn’t the way out 
But now each one is mouthing truths in lies designed like webs 
All through the wood all dry and powdered 
My temper day to day is their landlord 
Get out
