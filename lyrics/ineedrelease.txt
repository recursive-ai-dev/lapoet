I’m so far gone from the drugs I can’t hear the sermon that forgot its god and all the promise there was
Leaves fall sideways in the silence giving paper cuts in autumn fog that's blinding the cause
Of why I'm sniffing half-ass excuses with ghosts who quote my last wrong, and so it was until I coughed
Relapsing until I pass talking in solemn's thought, then calling bluffs
Spores of existential bruising bloom inside the lungs and mind like moss across a tundra 
Proving movements aren’t healing, but surviving in a dance of hunger 
Built up trust under the pile of garbage from my failed attempts there in the summer
winter comes and all that's left is to feel the regret and love 
Now the people walk on blessings given, drippings flicked from wet cigarettes
From all the residence that're peering 
lost apostles on their decks appearing to be cautious 
And they bet within their heads that I'm the one that's wrong
Less than ever heaven above means anything but trouble
What's regret in confirmation legacy was dark not chartered
Not a rising of a sun but realizing there was not
A test to see the test is seeking lessons in the truth rotting
I go to get some escape at the gas station
Fluorescents humming post-mortem lullabies are simply fascinating
Standing at the patience testing ladder, with some fattened ape, telling me his ex is coming to give him his 10 bucks he had last week
So I give in and ask him why does she owe him the last 10 
He simply said a little line of why I try

All roads lead to 
hydroplaning off the high end 
Crashing in to honest times 
It’s kind of bittersweet 
I need release, but also dying

I've been having conversations with my friend and brother
Fully into all the same shit that we'd laugh at under what is up
At the end I glance and now they stand where nothing comes and never was
Then turn into my sanity summed, a number from the drugs that always comes to one
One more done
Fuck done
I am the drugs
So I start to question noises in the thunder in the sunlight cover
A group of voices poisoning my come up from the blood that wrote a connotation from the rough they never wanna claim, just block 
They blame, pretending what and who I'm talking to might not be kinda fake 
The face that brushes against touch is not the face they make when shunned
Connection works better in trusting claims that struggle cause the ponds 
Are filled with crunching from the bones of frogs and cadence when they'd talk 
Before knowing that they're safety depends on who you are or who you was 
So under their feet now they walk in thuds and creaking floorboards they know you probably have something like heart there beating under
never step over just because some brought up failing fucked the water
Now you go and drink from places that are mostly mud containing whatever is done
I'd trust a new letter over the older constant breaking patterns just to try to claim a new spelling of honor
Cause for all I know they're voices trying prove they are the ones who'd guide me through a crude lit tunnels that go somewhere the struggle isn't crossing between love or what I call it now
Running from a place that I end up is just me pacing 
And from what I've learned, discovering a asafet, no likes me pacing
And I've been trying to do the same as if I'm climbing through the growth that found a life in concrete rows and all fallout from the breaking of the car that crashed it had partly ripped it out what had lasted
What had fought
It's way impossible 
The start is all there was in what is honestly not even loss
It's all a come to say around the ever burning plots they cautioned all one day would drain to leave a tinder block for clocks to reflect consciousness absolving energy that brings a shock until it burns right through the parted flesh and now it is a constant aching
Brutal effigy of products accumulated to cross with what is won and what is taunting

All roads lead to 
Hydroplaning off the high end 
Crashing in to honest times 
It’s kind of bittersweet 
I need release, but also dying
I never could achieve it
Better breathe and call my ego
Tell him, boss, don't worry got it done
I'm going home for the evening
