Painting the chaos when 
Pain meets today’s losses   
I am now raising my hands 
To get lifted from all of the flames on the ledge of the mantle 
That had once displayed a failed walk across a bridge   
Past seemed to make the fucking days long So fast now in it   
And I’m done playing with the drugged up séances 
The problem was entities they claimed they were honest   
Then they traded all talk for days they would haunt me and sway my interests   
Trees, they are out walking now 
No one’s standing here to watch them living   
And as the branches see the ages 
Handing fear to all the lost hope   
So unforgiving 
Leaves they fall in place   
Showing patterns of a crossed road 
Intentions scattered   
I once painted until I fucking lost hold 
At least a thrill   
The what do we have left to say is better taken cold   
Talking is becoming no option than leaving us frozen   
Leave the cloth up on the table to keep the rings of loss from showing   
Keep me wrong, breathe in the fable 
Tell me what to call what’s owed   
When the seasons change 
Relieve the pain   
Never thought time would heal a rock under my skin   
And now it throbs, I pick my arm   
I guess shock isn’t a given when you’re caught up in an everlasting dream   
I roll my shoulders, I feel a prod and pull   
I think I am with demons in a consequence of locking doors   
Now that’s some closure 
I keep them in 
Mind bleeds black ink onto canvas 
Each stroke a guttural scream against what I now see and of what I used to be amidst the habits 
Pouring all out of my skull   
And now the world, it fractures around balance 
Filling up   
Reflecting mirrors mirror liquid to ten times my reach, so it drowns me   

As we loop around and round recursion
Stakes grow ever higher 
How much can our minds now bend
And break With patience gtired
Long inside the now 
Can't save me
Safety on the fire
Burn and then we heal to burn again
So we'll find out

Here, amidst the wreckage, I commune with the ghosts of my ambition   
I’m still itching for a hit, I’ve left a bill up on the table   
What’s decisions made against decisions faced 
What’s the land come to   
A change, against the grain we have persuaded youth   
To forget what makes them 
A purchase in this swirling earth   
Leaves debt to my unknown fate I’ve learned a purpose for the hurt   
Is death is now a known place 
Death is our only fate   
Count your laughs 
Count today   
As one more day towards saving Of all hate and of all pain

As we loop around and round recursion
Stakes grow ever higher 
How much can our minds now bend
And break With patience gtired
Long inside the now 
Can't save me
Safety on the fire
Burn and then we heal to burn again
So we'll find out

Ashes of my passion mixed with habits and my actions
Turned this rubble in to dust
Inhale dysfunction and impale my fate with horns
The sword would never slay the thing abhorrent 
Entertaining or what some people sort of look away from mourning
But I didn't look away, I claimed it home
In the fucked up place we know there's only no one left
But no one said the black flame isn't lit
Just isn't shown and when you take step
There's no depth, you should've known
What I claim is not your best days ever spent
Or safety in the cold
Fuck your mortgage  
I am portioning my order of some blow
