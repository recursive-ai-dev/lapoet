Woke with a finished cigarette in my mouth 
Tasted old pills 
I sniffed
I felt a tragic sting 
Like giving me hell was more for giving yourself a sense of worth 
I bleed out from worlds I birthed within a lasting dream 
Of self medication on couches 
I seek a reason too, but it’s you who seeks an out
More like please just let me be a person 
Not be what you need to sell to greed, could be a curse
I doubt it 
But through the green and grey, the swollen bees, they turn 
Into a theme of how the earth, it breathes the now 
Broken promises leave lots of rot 
Amidst the sold out plots of cottages along the coast of thought 
But now the ocean’s red from all the hope left out 
Exposed to other’s problems 
Soaked in pain, is growth not known to stop 
Until a told of age 
Alone and got a daughter 
I got a lot 
Now 
I know a glowing flame can open crossing options 
On a poster was a face that slowly talked 
I choked, then watched him 
And he told me things about a closer day to when there was no shock 
Touching a fence to play there with the dogs, there was no caution 
But you wouldn’t want to now 
They are just hounds of shadow walking through a plane of stolen love 
And while the balance shatters between faded days they found 
And those they sought 
The challenge faced was gathering an army of the gone and dark 
And battled shame lost to the cannons aimed along the charge 
I guess we have become a growing problem 
I only know the talk 
Chasing the gone 

Today is a lot 
Save me a thought 
Say we’re not lost 
In an endless stretching void of clocks 
All praising exploding gods 

These gods collapse to hollow husks 
Thin ash on broken foundings 
And there’s no drugs left 
Just motions 
No calls in to distant family
The coming crashes leave them in a dug hole drowned in 
Barely a punishment earned, but learn
Something must come to show a balance 
Grounds enough for shadows cast 
In moments unconcerned with shadows 
And decrees, they cease, no common fuss 
A different tension now
This vast expense of spirit crushed 
Where prayers go unreturned, they’re downhill 
A chasm opens with their trust 
A bitter lesson learned, a pattern found
It barely dawns a beacon’s love 
And those forsaken shared the told of downing 
With the dead 
Just phantoms dancing on a fading dream on grounds
No instant shedding of what lead them to believing in a heavy crown 
Among the wreckage 
They were caught in numbed assumptions 
Ask for more, some peasants blood upon the crown
Instead, in this cold trance, now can’t function 
Unanswered, burned, and with each failing gasp 
A wasted sun 
It burns away, the earth, she’s scared of all the loud shit, coming pulses 
Running round unholy trumpets
Dare we breathe in scarce tree givings
When comfort’s just a talon in our backs 
And dumb luck to be found, but careful reaching up when
There is fog and you can’t see the hounds leap 
Ripping memories from once lived
If reason’s cloud above us 
Unburdened eagles rip our hope from solemn laws once carved in to a crumbling tablet, hung with rope
A savage jest, these plaster ceilings 
Like gathered dust in deepened muck 
Their children allowed the taken path 
When hope’s a broken mug
And innocence, that tender grace 
Is gone into the growing smoke
Fuck this resignation’s sound 
We’ll scream to feel some true release 
Not hollow thoughts on stone-cold battles, the mountain's a stubborn plastic one
Of destiny, a thousands years faced alone through oceans groaning loud 
Mostly counting teeth amidst the frozen palace of the ascended
Hold the crown

Today is a lot 
Save me a thought 
Say we’re not lost 
In an endless stretching void of clocks 
All praising exploding gods

Today is a lot 
Save me a thought 
Say we’re not lost 
In an endless stretching void of clocks 
All praising exploding gods
