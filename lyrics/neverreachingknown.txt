neverreachingknown

it started as a question of why am I hearing the neighbors music at 4am as if it was inside
just three notes bent wrong through waves and patterns binding without clashing
spreading through my mind like I've mistaken claims of space for life and passion 
like a nerve ending within my mouth screaming from inside the rations
or just by simply drinking water from trying to live in madness
What is surviving to a god that's walked beside a fallen father that had silenced them for profit out of tragedy
I have broke a broken clock to reach a time when I once had a sense of why is this all rot and violence dancing, seeming happy
Crossing misplaced sadness with the lies unplanned and trials here blackened
Now the wallpaper collapses into rhymes and rhythms blasting
mixing up with pride that I once chased to flame, don't mind the habits
vibrating in the floorboards of the shed is why does this all matter
at the edge of my mind is not a question or an answer
It is getting through the day and finding dine that I can scavenge
humming through fluorescent lights, time was never there or after

i didn’t choose it
but it chose me
or maybe
i composed it to remind myself
That I myself am passing
Never reaching known
I found a note I left undamaged
From a ghost I've know since all I've known
And none will know there after

left it running
a voicemail from my past self
You’ll need this please don’t mute it
it's the meaning you have searched for and have now found in music
it’s the only thing keeping this real
as impossible it seems 
In the container lays a lie of a contained infinity that's proving nothing
I seen a chick walking with anger his name was babe
And so far danger becomes a place that you can claim is safety, that's of course untill it's not
they cross the walk and walk across their love with footsteps naming cloth with dirty spots
and loss that's turned the root of interest into a cause, no letting go
what is the truth
sometimes screams breaking through the lasting hope
shredding up the silence like it’s trying to carve through the ego or vines that talk  
sometimes they whisper just to remind you there is time to follow opposites of interest
For a line will surely show
In this recursion there is no line it folds itself in place
the past and future is a climb 
when all you have to do is face it and step to the side
observe there was no trying
trying was a face that gets caught up in motions trying to hide that flying never saved us
and still I sit
that solo climbs and falls
no matter where I go and if it one time stops I guess I'll find the silence never knows

i didn’t choose it
but it chose me
or maybe
i composed it to remind myself
That I myself am passing
Never reaching known
I found a note I left undamaged
From a ghost I've know since all I've known
And none will know there after

i didn’t choose it
but it chose me
or maybe
i composed it to remind myself
That I myself am passing
Never reaching known
I found a note I left undamaged
From a ghost I've know since all I've known
And none will know there after
