Light coming at me at an unfamiliar angle 
I will kill the curse  
Sick of being brought down to my  knees in danger just to feel the dirt  
Sick of eating rot 
The crowns have fallen, paintings are now gone  
Safes begin to turn to 
Crows all on the hunt  
For a crawling bug to lift and hurt 
I see the sun appear  
I scream a curse 
What is conditional love to a clear narcissist  
If 
I don’t appear to you perfect 
Are you just gonna up and give up on us  
Whispering trees, they say 
You just fear what you can’t   get in crumbs or a gift 
Distilled infected returns  
Still retain what left them leaving earth on a end 
In a spiritual way  
Living is gone 
Cannot return  
Cannot rebirth 
You are awakened  
I’m feeling crumbled, images of what used to be 
Are ripped up and fading, cannot see birds swerve  
And my aversion to what’s first turns 
Leaving the ever turning wheel   of time to spin further 
Maybe discover a meaning  
Escape the prison planet 
They will fake a disturbance, reaping us  
Until we are feeding off lies 
Like a fucking nutrient planned out,   not new to this 
Put your hand down  
We keep on kneeling 
But who we kneel to mimes and all  
Just acts proud 
And if we’d see the ill moves  
Read between what’s taught 
And all the lines of what is posed  
And what’s frowned upon and showed to us 
And notice clean slates aren’t nearing any   time near or after dawn 
Cliffs they make sense  
Walk along the edge and feel exposed 
I will not end it  
But 
I’ll take the leap to  feel what could be motion 
Better the caws piercing through  the static gnawing at my sanity  
Than the thoughts that you and 
I  couldn’t be part of what’s lasting  
I’m feeling last at pick, an  addict with some passion or a gift  
Feels like a curse within me 
I wanna give up  
Cause self reflection is really a flaw 
Cause when self destruction is an art  
I sure will paint another world 
See you never on
