crossings

Silence answers any question 
I have as  the past and present merge in to a moment of why shit matters on this ruined plot of perfect talk and curvature  
But never walking through the plots half forgotten or returned or low end 
That were sold for profit, blessed with the bread under the laws we turn to 
Now just sitting there with broken locks  
Spray paint found 
Images, no effort, shocks  
Just letters really now aren’t they 
And they spell out fuck the dead and fuck the cops  
I guess to fuck with pity 
Loss is one day  
Can only gain from here 
And all the crossings aren’t lockpicks  
Meet me at the fog 
We’ll block eternity  
And watch the sun end 
Go to every other star in every other galaxy  
Amidst the never ending dream we call a balance 
And begin to watch as all the lights go out all around us 
Until nothing but dark  
The clouds of gas are not lit up 
And now bound to eternal truth  
We could find our peace 
Blind to each  
But please look now 
There isn’t sight but there is me

I blinked and half my life went by
I feel like I have taken
All I could've built and rigged up high explosive
Watch the towers crumble

Rot-slick roots strangle the atlas, veins  clogged with whatever 
I scraped up for lunch  
I autopsy seasons when 
I’m manic, find each leaf  retreats when the blood constricts but it’s not because their cold, it’s for the bigger picture 
Each king on top his hill has hope to at least see the next winter 
Drop now  
Still 
The river 
I had found myself in, whispering debts 
I can’t pay yet through the wind  through the corridor of green tainted every shade of orange, red, and what 
I had did to attain this 
To cause everything to seem out of place, like 
I was never even meant to get this far anyway 
Just need another hit soon  
Why does love die, the crushed hate 
Why does still lie the pain?

I blinked and half my life went by
I feel like I have taken
All I could've built and rigged up high explosive
Watch the towers crumble

I blinked and half my life went by
I feel like I have taken
All I could've built and rigged up high explosive
Watch the towers crumble
