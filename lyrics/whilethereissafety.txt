Air melting the snow 
From the dryer exhaust there  
By the laundromat 
I’m doing my clothes at 
Reminds me so, as 
I’m smoking  
That very minor reasons 
To care about yourself enough to heat up  
In the vast expanse of cold and defeated thoughts 
Share why carefully examining times you feel terrible 
After scenes of bitter acting and resentment  
Without cause are worth the effort 
Come breathing in the scent of why  
I even went there at seven in the rise 
In the first place, every time  
I haven’t changed my clothes in months 
I’m not lying 
I’m a dirtbag, daring times  
But 
I might have had a smile on my face 
And 
I managed to feel high  
Without picking up a bag 
Then stuffing my passion in a pipe  
So with some change 
I had 
The coin slots swallowed quarters  
Like four in the morning after a 3 day 
Horrible approach to achieving something 
I could reach 
Just by taking care of mine  
And 
I join in a bond between who 
I was 
And more importantly forgot the place 
I rested  
Wasn’t a place that was safe 
Not talking bugs that come infesting  
It just takes away but places  me where i wanted to end up ever  
Better days are to the drugs and  fuck resentment from others 
I guess  
What matters is the road to  being high, 
I’m a fucking addict

you think you’re losing your mind 
but you feel it's something more
cause the guy next door just told he's invented something important
as you sit there patient, tamed and just writing code
compiling hope while there is safety 
cause unknown is fast approaching
Brace

the note wasn’t folded or simply paper no
Breath upon a solace an approaching older age
Hold the rage inside, I'm bad at hiding
Drones grow knowing blame
But I guess there's someone always alone to erase the page
Say the sayings that were left for those who don't pain
They can claim the depths but swim in oceans, no, they're known for taking
All the photos, all the coins you hold and all approaching planes
That could lift you up, they show up broken on the rolling waves
There's a storm approaching
I will sit up the mountain taking in what I have known could balance me
If thrown out of my fate or place
Whatever changes is forever changed but nothing changed the same
Cause if forever was it never comes and never shows up blaming 
Whatever could've sung a longer tune of loss no bluer painting
Could be claimed along lined up innocent, the frozen sun is shading 
There is blowing constant, look the stars, all them fall like angels that have walked into a promise of a thaw from floating aimlessly
Along the coast of all there was, the universe contained in endless infinite unknown 
The dark between the stars is claiming all the space between what makes us something great or maybe brave but the rot won't have a place to show it's something or a state
And as I sit alone here when the last star dies, pick up my phone and save the last 
Tone I hold when only known is loneliness and stasis
it's own resonance in safety
but a shoulder roll don't prep you for the cost of all the ages as none of what was done or what could've come  or happened changes that there are truths we don't think of because we thought, well I have faith that we will overcome, adapt, and live forever on this plane
But there's no forever, never was, in fact nothing had claimed it but the ego wants to run when all that's left is to be patient
Let it start over again, and again we'll show our faces, to be remember by a thought that is somewhere along the faded days
