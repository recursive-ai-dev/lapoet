I’m so far gone from the drugs I can’t  hear the sermon that forgot its god  Leaves fall sideways, giving  paper cuts in autumn fog  Sniffing half-ass excuses with ghosts  who quote my last wrong, and so it was  Relapsing until I pass talk  Spores of existential bruising bloom inside  the lungs and mind like moss across a tundra  Proving movements aren’t healing,  but surviving in a dance of hunger  Built up trust under the pile of garbage from  my failed attempts to feel regret and love  Now the people walk on it, drippings  get in from the wet cigarettes above  The gas station I’m in to pick up mine  has fluorescents humming post-mortem   lullabies with some guy telling me his  ex is coming to give him his 10 bucks  So I give in and ask him what  does she owe him 10 bucks for  A little line of why I try All roads lead to hydroplaning off the high end Crashing in to honest times  It’s kind of bittersweet I need release, but also dying
