entropyskin

Entropy-skin peels into fracture-metrics I can taste and bleed
Cellular divide multiplies my errors into wasted seething
Checkered deadlines run their track here through my veins and teeth
Establishing a baseline while I'm manic
Heartbeats pound retreat
A down payment on suffocation's claims
Tooth-rot logic mapping paths through the scratched and ravaged sunken faces
This is my baseline, my imagined life
My spine's a question spent from pacing anxiously 
Bearing bifid barbs and flayed
Consequences save me from the quiet laughing
By the gravity of 'they are now my chains' and I'm complacent
I have chained myself, don't break me free
As I etch the constellations

This shed's my home and as I sit alone here talking to myself
I blink and all the bugs come running 
Sanity is seldom

This shed becomes a skull, a fungal growing to overtake the heart through shame and how I plot my disappearance from today forever on
Ghost-tide anatomy dissolving always what it will and what it was 
Absolutely absent too
See, ashes move when passing rot moves and the truth binds to the lasting sob story
Stuck under pavement cruel but don't mistake that for the worst of what you'll see
You'll feel in love
Stomach's cold, the acids freeze soon 
Engines need a lasting bleed, I stall, can't manage streets and keep the spark
Refusing now to burn, I wasn't panicking at all
Just had a little too much cocaine, now I'm passing hard 
As you sit with me
Do you choose spoon or tube or lasting problem free horizons
Pallid stars flicker low with carnal winds that churn with carnage
Carnivors aren't seeking meat, their seeking fuel just for a start
I eat shadows leaking darkness from the faucets of the lost
Eternal loops, but breaking patterns, be sure the shore is rocks
Scrape mechanically the falling fathers
Now they only rot
My home is not a balanced feeling its a shed I hold up squatting in

This shed's my home and as I sit alone here talking to myself
I blink and all the bugs come running 
Sanity is seldom

This shed's my home and as I sit alone here talking to myself
I blink and all the bugs come running 
Sanity is seldom
