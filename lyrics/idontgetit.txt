I taught pain to slowly dance under the moon 
Beneath the stars, and in my hands 
There was a beautiful and unusual fleeting chance to accept what has become not of my plans 
Midway between what joy 
I seek and ruin it brings 
And the bloom within the vanity of my thoughts that drink deep here 
From the well left in my heart 
Full of self harm reduction journal notes and pale coughs seemingly from exposure 
To the dark, to the light 
I thought 
I knew you once 
I wrote yesterday, today, and tomorrow lying 
And threw them in a book that you read, 
I moved that night
And said 
I read it 
I didn’t
I lied 
I guess, could you accept this why 
I scribed my doubts into the footnotes hidden right beneath and behind my pride 
And yes, you could say 
I screwed up 
You can see them on my face 
I am not good at hiding lies 
I kinda look dumb when 
I do 
I check my phone for messages 
I never sent 
Not one or two 
About a dozen 
I fucking left there 
I just forgot to send them 

Never told a lie that I didn't believe 
That I could've achieve if I tried
Now the sun is dying
And as we sit here, dear, all quiet
I talk like the lies that ended sunlight, they meant nothing

There wasn’t really an ill intention 
I walk these empty streets at night trying to at least outrun my best 
But 
I’m a slow walker and not running had gotten me this far anyways 
And 
I’m lazy as fuck and trust me 
By time 
I reach my apartment 
I’m even lazier than 
Look for forgiveness in the eyes that won’t seek a blessing, left them dark 
Tired of pretending 
I have it all figured out, but then here starving 
What’s the ending to the depths not even discovered but oh have 
I ever felt them 
I breathe in deep regret and my mind turns cold and let go of the shards 
Of the remnants of the sound when we’d go by the river down the block 
There would be a life lived on each drop of water that moved right past 
The days we didn’t think that life would end up saving face when talking 
Just to hook the line 
And all 
I can say is 
I don’t get it 

Never told a lie that I didn't believe 
That I could've achieve if I tried
Now the sun is dying
And as we sit here, dear, all quiet
I talk like the lies that ended sunlight, they meant nothing

What is there to get, my understanding’s 
This is all a test 
And when it ends we’ll be brought to our friends and family 
That we once wept for 
When we once send them to the past 
Well here’s the present 
What is better than being brought the gift of life 
After most of mine 
I was feeling dead 
Just an addict wasting lines 
I wasn’t acting 
But 
I fought through blood and sweat and bile and took apart the place 
And put it back together 
And a part of me is never going to bed without remembering 
The darkness leads to darkness 
And the light when it goes out of style 
It just leads to more darkness 
Now how the fuck does anyone get out 
Don’t tell me 
I have been mistaken and this goes and ends with hell 
Or some rebirthing into tragedy or pain that 
I can’t help 
No matter where 
I go or what 
I do 
The ending’s always never 
Whatever is this waking life 
I gotta starve to find some shelter 
I don’t get it

Never told a lie that I didn't believe 
That I could've achieve if I tried
Now the sun is dying
And as we sit here, dear, all quiet
I talk like the lies that ended sunlight, they meant nothing
