Air melting the snow 
From the dryer exhaust there  
By the laundromat 
I’m doing my clothes at 
Reminds me so, as 
I’m smoking  
That very minor reasons 
To care about yourself enough to heat up  
In the vast expanse of cold and defeated thoughts 
Share why carefully examining times you feel terrible 
After scenes of bitter acting and resentment  
Without cause are worth the effort 
Come breathing in the scent of why  
I even went there at seven in the rise 
In the first place, every time  
I haven’t changed my clothes in months 
I’m not lying 
I’m a dirtbag, daring times  
But 
I might have had a smile on my face 
And 
I managed to feel high  
Without picking up a bag 
Then stuffing my passion in a pipe  
So with some change 
I had 
The coin slots swallowed quarters  
Like four in the morning after a 3 day 
Horrible approach to achieving something 
I could reach 
Just by taking care of mine  
And 
I join in a bond between who 
I was 
And more importantly forgot the place 
I rested  
Wasn’t a place that was safe 
Not talking bugs that come infesting  
It just takes away but places  me where i wanted to end up ever  
Better days are to the drugs and  fuck resentment from others 
I guess  
What matters is the road to  being high, 
I’m a fucking addict
