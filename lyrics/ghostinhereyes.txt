I felt unwelcome in the silence
Stranger to your heart 
Insane and feeling partially fake from feeling love
Why the hell am I in hell in an early winter fog
I’m a bit fucking selfish, won't doubt me when it's all over
Secrets rot in the safety of the hell I'm in
Not feeling quite myself, I'm not helpless but the hell with it
Turn a scene in to parts
Surely keep you locked in to an assurance leaving scares
Time passes bleeding hearts, they'll give
And I get it got to into trying to do myself
Call my selfish
I am much more than selfish, I'm a god
Isn’t sinking said to replenish the well water in our bucket
Then we should sit in the center
My sin is sipping particles and parasites
Addressed to her was barely kind
Now I wish instead of sending a note
I sent a stare at life
Or an untraceable poison
You cannot catch me in the shared moonlight
I’m wind in the dead of the senses
Sensing that this isn't right

I said stay, she flinched with the knife
Held my breath, a ghost in her eyes
She said lonely is this life
And if I had my fucking way
We'd both leave it smiling

Stay, don’t lift up the knife
Held my breath, a ghost in her eyes
She said lonely is this life
And if I had my fucking way
We'd both leave it smiling

She said don’t help me as I watch her fall into a pit of sorry
I won’t be alright today or when the fear leaves me a target
There was a time that I would listen
Chimes in the bitter solace
Singing don’t go with the vibe
So I brought her a piece of cloth
And said we could die tonight
I know this time it's different sorrow
Our souls combine
I chose a time
Hanging there in unknown perspective 
Posed up as a style 
But approach her and you'll know it's destined
Every motion and the roach that’s hiding under the ledge
Eyes to the fists
She would throw them both violently in bed
My toes dipped in cold water
Shy
No feeling as I break a hole through the ice that hold the dead under an ocean of my lies

I said stay, she flinched with the knife
Held my breath, a ghost in her eyes
She said lonely is this life
And if I had my fucking way
We'd both leave it smiling

Stay, don’t lift up the knife
Held my breath, a ghost in her eyes
She said lonely is this life
And if I had my fucking way
We'd both leave it smiling
