iterations

I dunno what iteration of the loop I've been stuck in lately
I've abused myself like patients under crude lighting and pacing pages blank now
Never knowing what to do when I circle savings
A person's worth is what has or hasn't served a purpose lately
Never learn, every truth deserves assurance, not celebration
A recursive fucking noose that I hadn't loosened but had tall and braced up, like just take me
I am tooth decay and basic failings
With all you'd ever prove that I was when wasting all the claims
I but had tall and braced up, like just take me
I am tooth decay and basic failings
With all you'd ever prove that I was when wasting all the claims
I brought up in the blue when I'd tell you I was choosing cost and safety at the crossing
Between waves and shorelines and their fathers aching, I need water
I have lost my fucking mind under the sky, approaching crows see falling locks and iron shavings
Seeing all the parasites eating up my given interests lately
Give a little time although all there was vision, and what it isn't faking
Never drawn a line cause all I've walked were not some bridges I would not turn back just to light them up for all our interests
There is ever falling ashes from burning past them or past them, it reaches all my living family and lasted
All the cast of shadows laugh at all I've said
A task I'm seeking to first, but I pass it seeking verses in it
A ladder reaching up further collapsed when breaching, the burden ended
When I seen there was no ladder just a version my sentence in this senseless send
A black ink over curses no lasting, endless, no never learned, no center of the earth, worth what has and handed
A bird seeking the dead, the death of all ascended
They stand at the wall that they had climbed with all their fire within
A perfect circle, back to the hurt but never hurting friends I guessed 
But had I checked my phone I'd see no way to contact cleansing
A thirst for rust filled water, these water lines are clogged up 
Entrances with the circling recursion caught up to bother me not in attendance

I sit here like a snake eating its own tail
Caught in recursion
I'd say I never learn
But I learned it once
And return to it

Sitting like a snake eating its own tail
Caught in recursion
I'd say I never learn
But I learned it once
And return to it
