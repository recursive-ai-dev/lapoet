the note wasn’t folded or simply paper no
Breath upon a solace an approaching older age
Hold the rage inside, I'm bad at hiding
Drones grow knowing blame
But I guess there's someone always alone to erase the page
Say the sayings that were left for those who don't know where they place
They can claim the depths but don't swim in oceans that are known for taking holed up broken ships
All the photos, all the coins you hold and all approach forgiving
That could lift you up, they show up broken on the rolling waves
There's a storm approaching
I will sit up on the mountain taking in what I have known could balance me
If thrown out of fate or place established
Whatever changes is forever changed but nothing changed the same
Cause if forever was it never comes and never shows up blaming 
Whatever could've sung a longer tune of loss no bluer face
Could be claimed along the lined up innocent, the frozen sun in shade
There is a blowing constant, look the stars, all them fall like angels 
That have walked into a promise of a thaw from floating aimless
Along the coast of all there was, the universe contained in endless infinite unknown 
The dark between the stars is claiming all the space between what makes us something great or maybe something brave 
But rot won't have a place to show it's something constant or a state
And as I sit alone here when the last star dies, pick up my phone and save the last tone that I hold when only known is lone and stasis
It's own resonance in safety
but a shoulder roll don't prep you for the cost of all the ages 
As none of what was done or what could've come or happened could've changed it 
There's truths we don't think of because we thought we hold our faith
Well I have faith that we will overcome, adapt, and live forever blaming
But there's no forever, never was, in fact, nothing had claimed it 
But the ego wants to run when all that's left is to be patient
Let it start over again, and again we'll show our faces
To remember by a thought that there is someone pure among tainted

you think you’re losing your mind 
but you feel it's something more
cause the guy next door just told you he's invented something important
as you sit there patient, tamed and just writing code
compiling hope while there is safety 
cause unknown is fast approaching
Brace
